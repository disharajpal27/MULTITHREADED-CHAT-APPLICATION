**DESCRIPTION OF TASK** 
The Multithreaded Client-Server Chat Application is a real-time messaging system built using Java Sockets and Multithreading, allowing multiple users to communicate simultaneously. The server listens for incoming connections on a fixed port, assigns a separate thread for each client, and manages message broadcasting to all connected users except the sender. The client application connects to the server, enabling users to enter their names and exchange messages in a text-based interface. When a user joins or leaves, the server notifies other participants. The project utilizes Java Development Kit (JDK 11+), an Integrated Development Environment (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code), and a command-line interface for execution. Java’s built-in java.net.Socket and java.net.ServerSocket classes handle network communication, while multithreading ensures smooth interaction among multiple users. Core libraries include java.io.* for input/output operations, java.net.* for socket programming, and java.util.* for managing client connections. No external libraries were required since Java’s standard libraries efficiently support networking and threading. The development process involved using Java Official Documentation, Oracle Java Tutorials, Stack Overflow, YouTube tutorials, and GitHub repositories for reference and debugging. The output was generated by first running the server (ChatServer.java), which displayed "Chat Server is running on port 12345", followed by launching multiple clients (ChatClient.java) in separate terminals, each prompting the user to enter a name. The server logged new connections, and messages sent by one client were received and displayed by all others. For instance, if "Alice" typed "Hello everyone!", all connected clients saw "Alice: Hello everyone!". If a client disconnected, the server logged their exit and notified the remaining users with a message like "Alice has left the chat." The implementation ensures real-time message exchange with seamless connection and disconnection handling. By combining socket programming, multithreading, and I/O handling, this project successfully demonstrates the fundamentals of network programming in Java and provides a fully functional multi-client chat system.
